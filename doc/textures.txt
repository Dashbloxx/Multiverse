There are a number of different types of textures. These are:

GL_TEXTURE_1D: Images in this texture all are 1-dimensional. They have width, but no height or depth.
GL_TEXTURE_2D: Images in this texture all are 2-dimensional. They have width and height, but no depth.
GL_TEXTURE_3D: Images in this texture all are 3-dimensional. They have width, height, and depth.
GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE: The image in this texture (only one image. No mipmapping) is 2-dimensional. Texture coordinates used for these textures are not normalized.
GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER: The image in this texture (only one image. No mipmapping) is 1-dimensional. The storage for this data comes from a Buffer Object.
GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP: There are exactly 6 distinct sets of 2D images, each image being of the same size and must be of a square size. These images act as 6 faces of a cube.
GL_TEXTURE_1D_ARRAY: Images in this texture all are 1-dimensional. However, it contains multiple sets of 1-dimensional images, all within one texture. The array length is part of the texture's size.
GL_TEXTURE_2D_ARRAY: Images in this texture all are 2-dimensional. However, it contains multiple sets of 2-dimensional images, all within one texture. The array length is part of the texture's size.
GL_TEXTURE_CUBE_MAP_ARRAY: Images in this texture are all cube maps. It contains multiple sets of cube maps, all within one texture. The array length * 6 (number of cube faces) is part of the texture size.
GL_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE: The image in this texture (only one image. No mipmapping) is 2-dimensional. Each pixel in these images contains multiple samples instead of just one value.
GL_TEXTURE_2D_MULTISAMPLE_ARRAY: Combines 2D array and 2D multisample types. No mipmapping.
