# Multiverse
## What is Multiverse?
Multiverse is a 3D game that I plan on making in C, not C++ because C++ is unstable and excessively complex, and I can implement several features that C++ has into C myself.
## Where can I get it?
For now, Multiverse is only available for linux (and you have to build it from source), but soon it will be available for windows, and mac, and then android and iOS, w(when development starts catching up pace).
