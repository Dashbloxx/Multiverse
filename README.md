# Multiverse
## What is Multiverse?
Multiverse is a 3D game that I plan on making in C, not C++ because C++ is unstable and excessively complex, and I can implement several features that C++ has into C myself.
## Where can I get it?
For now, Multiverse is only available for linux (and you have to build it from source), but soon it will be available for windows, and mac, and then android and iOS, w(when development starts catching up pace).
## How do I launch Multiverse the right way?
Most of Multivere's code will be written in lua, which can be found in the `scripts` directory. To launch Multiverse the right way, you must run Multiverse with an argument as the path to the `main.lua` file which is found in the `scripts` folder. The command `make test` already does it for you.
